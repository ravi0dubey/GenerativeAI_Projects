First I would like to rate this phone in the following basics after 1 month of use
1) Battery life- 6000mah is a pretty huge and good performance battery.... Butvu have to take care of it if u want the same backup for the coming years... Don't on the battery saver when it's 55% or above... It can damage ur battery backup...
2) Display- It has a huge screen(6.5 inche Fhd+)with 90hz refresh rate(u can change it in the display setting)
Color are great
3) Camera- It comes with quard camera(50mp main, 8mp ultra wide, 2mp depth sensor and 2mp macro lens.). Quality of pics are awesomeüëç.... 50 Mp camera is the best to take any pics.
Front camera is 8mp and give best pics(use snapchat filters for best resultsüòÜ).
3) Performance or processor- It comes with mediatek helio g88 12 nm chipset. It gives u a high performance for gaming and multimedia surfing. BGMI graphic can be set up to HD in High fpsüòä.
4) -design- it's great buy the Bifrost option.
5) speakers- have dual speakers.. Best sound

Pros- camera is great
Performance is okay
Design is cool
Display is good
Battery is huge
Comes with a 22.5w charger and supports 18 w quick charging

Cons- heating problem üî•üî•üî•üî•
