strcutured_model1 = model_openapi.with_structured_output(Review)
result1= strcutured_model1.invoke("""Paying over 12k and getting a product with scratches how it will feel? The same feeling I had...it had scratches all over the product ....just ban this kind of sellers..and people please buy from a showroom so that you can check and buy...I bought this even after all the negative comments.
the frame and lens is fine just because the seller had no responsibility of the customers money iam returning this....worst experience I have ever had.

First I would like to rate this phone in the following basics after 1 month of use
1) Battery life- 6000mah is a pretty huge and good performance battery.... Butvu have to take care of it if u want the same backup for the coming years... Don't on the battery saver when it's 55% or above... It can damage ur battery backup...
2) Display- It has a huge screen(6.5 inche Fhd+)with 90hz refresh rate(u can change it in the display setting)
Color are great
3) Camera- It comes with quard camera(50mp main, 8mp ultra wide, 2mp depth sensor and 2mp macro lens.). Quality of pics are awesomeüëç.... 50 Mp camera is the best to take any pics.
Front camera is 8mp and give best pics(use snapchat filters for best resultsüòÜ).
3) Performance or processor- It comes with mediatek helio g88 12 nm chipset. It gives u a high performance for gaming and multimedia surfing. BGMI graphic can be set up to HD in High fpsüòä.
4) -design- it's great buy the Bifrost option.
5) speakers- have dual speakers.. Best sound

Pros- camera is great
