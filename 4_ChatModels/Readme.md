# Chat Models

******We have two types of Chat Models******
1. **Closed-Source Models**
2. **Open-Source Models**

```
i.  Open-source language models are freely available AI models that can be downloaded, modified, fine-tuned, and deployed without restrictions from a central provider. 
ii. Unlike closed-source models such as OpenAI's GPT-4, Anthropic's Claude, or Google's Gemini, open-source models allow full control and customization.

##### 2.max_completion_tokens
It is the count of token we get in output results. If we see result4, our answer is not even complete.

#### Code output
It seems GPT4 Chat models are trained till Oct 2024, hence it is unable to give latest output
